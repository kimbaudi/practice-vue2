# practice-vue2

**vue v2** / **vuetify v2** project installed using **npm** / **webpack 5**

```shell

yarn format

# lints and fixes files

Issues:

1. cannot update to sass to latest

   we must stay on sass v1.32.13 on vue 2 or upgrade to vue 3

   we need to upgrade to vue-cli v5 (and maybe vue 3)

   we cannot upgrade to vue3 until vuetify v3 is available

   vuetify v3 target release date is February 2022
